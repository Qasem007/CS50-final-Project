PROJECT TITLE : Task Manager
 Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/94HD06r8Tkc?si=P-OD_YYkIJ6a5wfh
 Description:

 This project is a Task Manager web application built with React (TypeScript + Tailwind CSS) on the frontend 

 and Flask (Python) with SQLite on the backend.

It allows users to:

Register and Login with secure authentication

Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) tasks

Store all tasks in a database for persistence

Use a responsive UI with modern design powered by Tailwind CSS


The frontend communicates with the Flask backend through RESTful APIs.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how a full-stack application 

can be developed by combining a modern frontend with a Python-based backend 

and database integration.
